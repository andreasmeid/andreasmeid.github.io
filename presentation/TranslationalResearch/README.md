# Interactive Diagram in Quarto

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have [Quarto](https://quarto.org) installed.
2. Run the following in the terminal:

```bash
quarto preview interactive.qmd
```

This will open a browser window showing the Reveal.js presentation with:

- Slide 1: Boxes only
- Slide 2: Arrows only (SVG)

Once verified, we can merge them into a single interactive slide.
