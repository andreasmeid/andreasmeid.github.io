The Sanofi iDEA-TECH Award is a significant milestone for our team in the field of pharmacoepidemiology! Ignacio Leiva-Escobar and Andreas Meid have been awarded the prestigious Sanofi iDEA-TECH Award Europe for their TREND-REVIVAL project. They are supported by Camilo Scherkl, who is involved in the project with analyses.

The one-year project has a clear objective: to link clinical study results with real-world data in order to improve the understanding of disease progression after the market approval of new therapeutics. This will make an important contribution to well-founded decisions and patient-centered treatments.
